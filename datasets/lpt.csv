This community has existed for nine years and has more subscribers than some smaller countries have citizens. (Belgium has 11.4m) 

We find  that over time our rules have become bloated and unwieldy, making the subreddit hard to moderate and more importantly, difficult to post to. 

Each rule we have was added for a very good reason at the time. (In the sidebar there is a rule saying no tips about rubber snakes. A few years ago there was an issue with rubber snake tips.)

But over the years we have added rule after rule and never removed any and this resulted in rules creep,  a sort of nightmarish morass you guys need to navigate when you want to post here. 

This ends today. We're massively overhauling the rules, removing most of the restricted tip list and making participating here a  lot easier.

------------------------------------

**Rules that we will keep**

No tips about:

Legal, parenting, driving, tips that break the law, hygiene (including toilet), religious, relationship, troll/ joke.

And no ads. No tips that are really just recommending a product or service. No ""Get Disney+, it's great"". 

----------------------------------------

It's going to take some time to get all this arranged, especially automod is a complete disaster of rule upon rule and legacy code that requires detailed attention. During this transition some posts that are not technically against the rules anymore may still be removed. We also reserve the right to keep removing content under moderator discretion, when we feel it's not a good fit for the sub but is not codified in our existing ruleset. 

But in general we feel that this overhaul will make it much simpler and enjoyable to participate here.

But often they don’t talk about how to do that. They just automatically spit out the cliché because it’s so widespread in our society. Cal Newport suggests “follow your passion” is terrible advice.

The first thing we need to understand about passion, is that passion is more about strategy than inspiration. We usually think along the lines of just waking up one day and we’ll randomly know our purpose. This law of attraction logic most likely won’t work in regard to finding our passions. Most of us find our passions in life through experimentation. It takes a bit of effort and self-analysis

And if you noticed I said PASSIONS, as in plural. I’m pointing that out because that’s another common misconception about passion. That we can only have one almighty singular passion in life. It’s mostly because of the influence of TV and society we think of passion as this singular thing. But it’s not

We can have several passions simultaneously. For instance, I myself love writing, love hitting the gym, love cooking and eat clean foods, and love learning new information. Most of us can have more than one passion. We aren’t bound to only one interest in life. 

Now before explaining how to find your passion this next point is the KEY to being able to become passionate about anything in your life in the first place. **Passion isn’t a starting point it’s a conclusion.** Meaning - we don’t start with passion, but we can end with it. 

Gaining Mastery in a subject is a fundamental part of passion. On the path to mastering anything we become passionate about that subject in general. The main point with this is to choose not only to become good at something, we need to aim high, remember we want to become a master at it and we can’t do that without aiming high. For example, not only do you want to write a book, you want to write a book that makes the best seller’s list. Not only do you want to open a restaurant; you want the best restaurant within 50 miles. By taking this high goal road, we start to look at the little details and intricacies of how everything connects in that field and we just sort of naturally get this need for more and more information about it - then we become fascinated with that subject and it leads us to becoming passionate about it. **Passion is automatic on the path to mastery**. 

So now let’s talk about how exactly we find our passions. I remember in my second year of college I was conflicted with if I choose the right major or not. I was talking to one of my professors about it and he showed me this simple little tool that’s a perfect starting point in respects to finding our passion. First he asked me what do I love to do? Then he asked, am I good at any of those things I love to do? Then finally he said do people need or value any of the things I am good at and love to do. Ask yourself these 3 questions and it’ll lead to your sweet spot in life.

We can toy with this equation too it’s not fixed. If we’re not finding the answer, we can dedicate some time to becoming better at the things we love that we also know the world values. We can even go as far as increasing the list of things we love to do by trying new things. Some we may like, some we may not. If it is not the right choice for you, you will know shortly after starting. But if we keep doing it, as time goes on that list of things we love to do will increase. 

Don’t over analyze or over think this part. Just google a list of hobbies and pick out a few that interest you. That your curious about and focus on one of them at a time to try out. 

Now if your discovering you’re not interested in anything then it’s likely your dopamine responses are off. Dopamine levels can have a lot more to do with passion than we would think on the surface. Paint a picture of yourself driving on a road leading you to your passion. Your dopamine levels being off will make that road foggy. The more cheap dopamine spikes we get from thing like TV, Video games, social media, high sugar foods, and other crap that throws off our dopamine responses off - The thicker that fog will be and the harder it will be to see the road we’re on. Then because the fog can become so thick we might miss an intersecting road that we we’re supposed to turn down or a road that just peaked our interest and would have been worth taking a detour on. 

In order to be passionate about things we need to let go of as many unnecessary dopamine spikes related to instant gratification as we can. When we watch a lot of TV, get high or drunk, or stay on social media all day it gives us an instant high dopamine response compared with what we should be getting as a delayed dopamine response while working on something we’re passionate about. If we avoid these things, we will naturally become passionate and happier about whatever we’re working on in life rather than just working on our image on Instagram. **Our dopamine responses have to come from what we create, not what we consume.** This is very important. With our dopamine responses in check we naturally seek out more dopamine responses through our creations and the work we put into our life. We’ll get our dopamine responses from earned activity like exercising, choosing the right foods to eat, completing tasks, and going for goals. Every instant high dopamine spike activity we let go of will make our road to passion clearer. 

So, in conclusion you can see how finding our passion will take some effort. This is exactly why the biggest block to most of us finding our passion is ourselves. Thinking we will just wake one day and suddenly know our purpose is wishful thinking at best. And when nothing comes to us, we tend to ask others what they think we should choose to do for our passion, defeating the whole concept of passion all together. This decision must be on our terms. Not what our mother or father thinks we should do and not what our friends think we should do. We can take suggestions, but the endgame of our life has to be a result of our own choices; and the biggest problem we have with passion, most of us don’t even get a chance to chase it, because we give up our dreams for a paycheck

I know it can be time consuming.  I know you have better shit to do.

Earlier today, I met an elderly gentleman at work (I'm a police officer).  He was nice enough, but it became clear that he was basically just looking for some company.  I made contact with this guy, who we'll call Jim.  Jim had a very simple problem - He was too weak to get his garbage pail down to the curb for garbage pick-up day and wanted to know if we could help him with that if needed.  Of course, this is the type of stuff we're here for.

Jim is wearing a WW2 veterans hat with a Sergeants pin on the brim.  I ask him ""Jim, is that your Sarge's pin on your hat?""  To which he responds yes.  We start talking.  Turns out, Jim is from a tiny US midwest town and went to WW2 in order to ""do what needed to be done"".  ""We had no idea about the Nazi's when we joined up...we just wanted to serve our Country""

Jim went on to tell me stories that literally left my jaw hanging.  He said he didn't like to talk about things, but because I was a police officer, he would talk with me.  How he was in France, Germany and, later, the Pacific.  He told me about his nurse wife, who ended up running off while he was away.  His new wife, who ended up passing of cancer.  His 2 boys, both of whom were also in the military.  He told me about how when he got out of the service and the war was over, how he went to work in his hometown as a factory worker.

Jim told me that he almost never spoke to anyone regarding the war and his experiences.  I asked if he ever spoke to his wife and kids, and he looked at me like I was nuts.  ""They have no need to know of these things.""  Fair enough I suppose.

He told me about people he had killed, in person, and right in front of him.  Almost as if it was simply a job.  ""Them boys had mama's, I knew it, but i tried not to think about it.""  Jim told me about factory life and his growing family..

Long story short, I asked Jim if he had talked to others about this, and he said, verbatim, ""who?  My kids are grown.  I don't see them.  You young people are so busy these days.""

tl;dr  This guy just wanted someone to talk to for a bit.  He wasn't annoying, he wasn't long-winded.  He was lonely.  At one point, he told me how he used to harvest corn on his dads farm.  He was lonely.  This generation is going to be completely gone soon, and if this is typical, they may not have folks to speak to and leave their stories behind.  We cant let the generation die with nothing.  Visit your old folks.  If you come across them, give it 5 minutes and BS with them.  Chances are, you're going to find something interesting enough to make you wish you'd done it sooner.

I am a **senior** in high school and have been with most of classmates since **6th grade**. For the most part, a lot of them have gotten into **Ivy League** schools or **Honors Colleges** and are destined to achieve great things. There are some people, *however*, that I have the displeasure of watching their lives slowly waste away. From drugs to just not caring, it is safe to say these people have had a fall from grace ever since I met them in 6th grade. 

* The first person I will mention is a girl I actually met on my first day of middle school and remain a good friend of hers to this day. When we shared classes together, she always performed leagues beyond everyone else, it was obvious life had something well in store for her. As high school rolled around, her life took a bad turn. Freshmen year was the same as middle school, even outperforming me in classes such as algebra and history, but then drugs came along. At first, she was only vaping, and I told her that this habit would lead to her eventually becoming a junkie. She laughed at such a notion, but eventually that statement became reality. Sophomore year was a real turning point as she started to take high level classes, but because of being constantly high when at home, she did terribly. Because I developed feelings for her (some of which i still do hold), I helped her as much as I could. It saddened me that as I progressed, she seemed to only downgrade. By senior year, her *3.9 GPA* when all the way down to around a *2.4*. Watching a great friend of yours lose a chance at a good life because of a high school addiction is **very painful to witness.** 
* The next mention on this list is not a person, but rather, *a group of people.* The **burnout jocks** in my grade have a *surprising amount of people* who are **smart**, but just act stupid because of their friend group. Last year, in my chemistry class, the highest performing student was someone who everyone else thought was a complete dummy. I discussed this with my chemistry teacher last week, and she told me that if he were in a different environment, he would perform much better in school. I have had many classes with this individual, and to be honest, he always acts like a complete idiot when with his friends, but I learned that he really can be smart, but chooses to be stupid because of the people he's with. In the math class I am in right now, there is another burnout jock that I actually knew was very smart since middle school. Once again, he suffers the same fate as the last jock: their friend group prevents them from achieving optimum performance. Both of these guys share the same friend group of people who don't give a shit about high school. **They see it more as a chore and that is not at all what high school should be.** On weekends, they get higher than kites and get so drunk its not even funny. It upsets me greatly that these people have the capability of being smart, yet don't act on it because of the character they put on with their friends. Sadly, most of these people are now going to a community college where they will most likely act the same way and achieve nothing. 
* The last person I am to speak of is actually one of my **best friends.** He hangs out with some of the smartest people in the grade, and although this is a good thing, his scores and **grades are nothing in comparison**. He is a true *minimalist* who really has no direction in his life at the moment. In the beginning of the year, he went from telling me he was applying to college, to joining the marines, to saying he's going to a community college. He's not an idiot either, but the choices he's making right now are pretty idiotic. He easily could have applied to a decent college and gotten in, but decided instead to just not do anything. His SAT was a 1000, and I knew he could've improved, but when the day of the next exam came up, he blew it off because he was, ""tired."" I've been in school with this guy for six years and now that we've finally come to the biggest turning point of our lives, he's blowing it off. In the classes we have together, he doesn't try, and I even heard a teacher tell him he's, ""not college ready."" He says he has a plan all figured out, but I honestly think he's just saying that to put his mind at ease. He wishes to major in Marine Biology, but at this rate, nobody really thinks he's up for the challenge. His laid back, minimalist, lassiez faire, high school policy has proven to be a major setback in his life and it saddens me he' not achieving his true greatness. 

All in all, the message still remains the same: **give your all in high school.** I have seen the rise and fall of many students across many friend groups and wish everyone to not suffer the same fate. High school is what leads to the beginning of the rest of your life, and if you throw it away, the future is unknown and frightening.

We have a neighbour from a few doors down so keeps parking on the flowerbed and it is destroying the glass and flowers. The problem is that as it’s on on the public road, they can’t get a parking ticket. So the most we can do is leave a polite note on the windscreen. We’ve done this about 5 times however and each time he’s read the note and torn it up.

&lt;p&gt;We have a neighbour from a few doors down so keeps parking on the flowerbed and it is destroying the glass and flowers. The problem is that as it’s on on the public road, they can’t get a parking ticket. So the most we can do is leave a polite note on the windscreen. We’ve done this about 5 times however and each time he’s read the note and torn it up.&lt;/p&gt;

I just wanted to share some tips on how to be comfortable and successful at work, school or anywhere else you have to communicate with other people. 

A very important thing is to not act how you feel. 
If you really dislike the people you're around and you have (bad) thoughts about them, don't show it.  Stay neutral.  Being hostile isn't the way to go, so the best thing to do is just go on about your day, and don't cause problems for yourself (unless you have to.)

If you're having a bad day, try not to let that have an affect on how you treat other people, or, affect your appearance.  You don't want to have negative energy.. that will turn people away from you (that's not good), unless that's what you want. 

If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  This is said very often, and in this case, it's helpful.  If what you say is going to offend someone, you probably shouldn't say it, just for your sake.  Even if you don't think you're being offensive, everyone doesn't think the same way or handle things the same.  So be mindful of what you say. 

If you need to remind yourself of these things on a daily, do so.  It will help!  If any of these are you and you really want to change, it is possible.  With work and determination you can better yourself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! &lt;/p&gt;

Me and my wife want to help him, **badly**. We are not fit ourselves but we encourage each other to work out on the regular basis. We always try to invite him and encourage him to work out with us. We’ve invited him to hike, to run… to walk even, like just going to downtown or going to a town event. We even installed a 100 lbs. punching bag in our back yard that we (wife and I) train with every evening after work ([here](https://imgur.com/Xf6WnQw) is a still of a video we took. It is not much but it’s honest workout). We have all the necessary equipment (extra gloves, extra wraps, extra jumping ropes…) for him to just put on and follow up, have himself start as he sees fit and later push him to do certain drills once he gets better at it. We use a fitness app that teach us how and what do to on all levels of experience but the thing is, he lacks motivation — he has none whatsoever and we fear that soon it’ll be too late. I just want to find ways to reach out to him on a personal level and help him. If we can’t then maybe a psychologist will do the trick but he also refuses that mean (I personally had gone with a psychologist for more than a year and it has been a wonderful experience for me and it really helped me A LOT to learn about myself and my life and I am truly grateful for that).

He is into gaming and I am as well (PCMR), maybe I can reach out to him through there? He’s about to finish his engineer degree and he has yet to find himself a job. He does not have a lot of social life other than his gaming and university friends. He goes with them like once every 1-2 months or so…

Please Reddit, how do I motivate him to be healthier? How do I make him understand that it is not too late? That he has us for help, that he will not be judged. That getting healthier will have such of an enormous positive impact on him. I dream of the moment he starts noticing his weight reducing. Imagining him smiling looking himself in the mirror, happy that he has accomplished something he never thought possible. I want him a better quality of life and keep pushing himself for more!

Expanded version, because I like talking too much:
My phone was getting worse and worse at charging, I would put the cable in and it wouldn’t charge. 

I would try the connector at a different angle and that would work. It would vibrate every few seconds as the connection was flaky.

It helped if if twisted the cable around the phone to keep the connector at a certain angle.
I was ready to give up. 

Finally, I realized that I’m an idiot, and that the connector port was gunked up with lint and fibers and, well, gunk.

So I took a paperclip, scraped the inside of the lightning port, and voila, it’s good as new.

I&amp;#39;ve hired plenty of people even though they didn&amp;#39;t meet the requirements for the position, and it has turned out great every time. I&amp;#39;m NOT saying that you should lie about you and/or your skills. Always be honest! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re looking for a job, apply for your dream job! Because you never know. Another thing is that you should also apply for jobs that doesn&amp;#39;t have open positions. They might be in the works of putting out an ad nd you saving them the trouble. Timing is a powerful thing. The worst thing that can happen is that they say no.  But they can also say yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do any of the dumb shit like forgetting your id or giving fake names. This is a legal, and rarely used system in place.&lt;/p&gt;

Right of way is a set of rules designed to maintain order, especially when vehicles are involved. Vehicles *are* dangerous and carry the very real capacity to injure or kill. It is extremely important that minimize this danger, which is partly done by maintaining order and thus keeping things predictable.

By giving up your right of way, you are not being friendly, but instead you are opening up the situation to become more unpredictable and dangerous. Obviously make sure others are yielding to your right of way before taking it, (again for safety as other drivers and pedestrians often make mistakes purposely or not) but don't give up your right of way for no reason.

Refresher for the U.S.:

- Whoever arrives at a stop sign first gets the right of way
- If two people show up at the stop sign at the same time, the person to the right gets right of way 
- Someone already on the road has the right of way over someone turning onto that road
- Pedestrians have the right of way at a crosswalk (unless signals say otherwise)
- Trains have the right of way at a railroad crossing

How does such wizardy work? It's pretty simple:  


1. Go to the [Google Images home page](https://images.google.com/) (or the Google home page, then click ""Images"" at the top right).
2. Click the camera icon on the right side of the search bar.
3. Upload an image or paste in the URL to the image.
4. ~~Profit~~  You'll get results suggesting what's in the picture.

Is it infallible? Mmm, probably not. I haven't tried all the pictures yet - but it can certainly be useful for certain applications.   


It can also be entertaining to see what Google comes up with.

We are in and out of those places multiple times for many different reasons on a day by day basis.

We see things, hear things, (smell things!) and sometimes have to deal with things inside of those facilities.

That being said, I'm not trying to scare anyone, most facilities are great! But there are other facilities we dread getting calls to, and some we feel bad we have to drop patients off at. EMTs do the job for various reasons but we as individuals are not loyal to any one facility (even if our company has the contract it is the company that pays us, not the facility directly) and from my experience, we are willing to honestly tell someone what we think of certain facilities.

Things to consider when you want to ask. First, find out which local company has the contract with the facility(ies) you are thinking of placing your loved one in. It is not hidden/private knowledge so the facility should be able to tell you without an issue.

Second (and important!): Do not approach any EMTs while they are with a patient, OR if they are inside the specific facility. We may be truthful, but it is possible to get in trouble if someone from the facility hears us talk negatively about it. Wait until you see the EMTs without a patient (empty stretcher) and at least outside of the facility. Best thing would be to be as far from an entrance as possible. If you happen to see an EMT at a store, chances are they have a few minutes to answer some questions.

Third: do not ask them while they are transporting your loved one. I typically got asked this question by a family member in the back of the ambulance with their awake and aware family member while we were heading to said facility as a new admission. I felt bad, but tried to be as truthful as possible without negatively talking about the facility. For me, it made me feel awkward as you are already heading to the facility, its too late to change places, and I wouldnt want you or your loved one to go in thinking its the worst place.

All that being said, we do not see EVERYTHING going on inside the facility and we have experienced varying stories from patient to patient. But there are some facilities that we as EMTs can all agree are terrible and those places are the ones you want to stay away from.

When you ask ""do you have any questions?"" it pre-supposes that the person doesn't have any questions. It's like saying ""you don't have any questions right? because if you did, you're stupid"". It's even worse if you are in a position of authority over the person your explaining something to (i.e. you're a teacher, a supervisor, etc...)

I'm a doctor, and I frequently need to explain something to someone that I understand better than they do. It's very easy to forget that a patient who's just come to the hospital to have a baby may have only had 1 or 2 babies, while you have gone through the process of caring for a pregnant woman thousands of times.

No matter what it is you're explaining, remember that if you are the one teaching or explaining something, you're doing so because you know more than the person you are talking to, and so it's only natural they will have questions.

Houses in my Midwestern US city regularly sell at or above their asking price after only a day or two on the market. This means that there are often multiple offers from which a seller can choose to accept. If you suspect that you don't have the best offer, you can write a personal letter to the seller to explain who you are and what living in the house would mean to you. Don't grovel or make things up, just explain the connection you feel to the property. Including a nice picture or two also goes a long way toward turning you into a human instead of numbers on a sheet of paper.

In our example, we didn't get to meet the owner before submitting an offer; however, we knew a few things about him just from touring the home. We saw doggy food bowls in the kitchen, so we included our dog Watson in our letter (he even signed it!) It was apparent from the garage that the owner liked cars; I included a line about how I was hoping to use the big garage as my shop.

Protect yourself first.

Keep your wits.

It’s better to take 10 seconds and evaluate the situation instead of running right in.

Always call 911. Don’t assume others have.

Give 911 quick, short, clear answers.

Don’t move seriously injured people unless you have to (like seeing flames in the car).

Keep people away from the road.

Don’t play doctor. Give basic first aid and possibly help with breathing (CPR) or major bleeding.

Keep the area clear (like keeping your car down the road) so emergency services have room to work.

When the professionals arrive, give them the right quick info and get out of their way.

This community has existed for nine years and has more subscribers than some smaller countries have citizens. (Belgium has 11.4m) 

We find  that over time our rules have become bloated and unwieldy, making the subreddit hard to moderate and more importantly, difficult to post to. 

Each rule we have was added for a very good reason at the time. (In the sidebar there is a rule saying no tips about rubber snakes. A few years ago there was an issue with rubber snake tips.)

But over the years we have added rule after rule and never removed any and this resulted in rules creep,  a sort of nightmarish morass you guys need to navigate when you want to post here. 

This ends today. We're massively overhauling the rules, removing most of the restricted tip list and making participating here a  lot easier.

------------------------------------

**Rules that we will keep**

No tips about:

Legal, parenting, driving, tips that break the law, hygiene (including toilet), religious, relationship, troll/ joke.

And no ads. No tips that are really just recommending a product or service. No ""Get Disney+, it's great"". 

----------------------------------------

It's going to take some time to get all this arranged, especially automod is a complete disaster of rule upon rule and legacy code that requires detailed attention. During this transition some posts that are not technically against the rules anymore may still be removed. We also reserve the right to keep removing content under moderator discretion, when we feel it's not a good fit for the sub but is not codified in our existing ruleset. 

But in general we feel that this overhaul will make it much simpler and enjoyable to participate here.

But often they don’t talk about how to do that. They just automatically spit out the cliché because it’s so widespread in our society. Cal Newport suggests “follow your passion” is terrible advice.

The first thing we need to understand about passion, is that passion is more about strategy than inspiration. We usually think along the lines of just waking up one day and we’ll randomly know our purpose. This law of attraction logic most likely won’t work in regard to finding our passions. Most of us find our passions in life through experimentation. It takes a bit of effort and self-analysis

And if you noticed I said PASSIONS, as in plural. I’m pointing that out because that’s another common misconception about passion. That we can only have one almighty singular passion in life. It’s mostly because of the influence of TV and society we think of passion as this singular thing. But it’s not

We can have several passions simultaneously. For instance, I myself love writing, love hitting the gym, love cooking and eat clean foods, and love learning new information. Most of us can have more than one passion. We aren’t bound to only one interest in life. 

Now before explaining how to find your passion this next point is the KEY to being able to become passionate about anything in your life in the first place. **Passion isn’t a starting point it’s a conclusion.** Meaning - we don’t start with passion, but we can end with it. 

Gaining Mastery in a subject is a fundamental part of passion. On the path to mastering anything we become passionate about that subject in general. The main point with this is to choose not only to become good at something, we need to aim high, remember we want to become a master at it and we can’t do that without aiming high. For example, not only do you want to write a book, you want to write a book that makes the best seller’s list. Not only do you want to open a restaurant; you want the best restaurant within 50 miles. By taking this high goal road, we start to look at the little details and intricacies of how everything connects in that field and we just sort of naturally get this need for more and more information about it - then we become fascinated with that subject and it leads us to becoming passionate about it. **Passion is automatic on the path to mastery**. 

So now let’s talk about how exactly we find our passions. I remember in my second year of college I was conflicted with if I choose the right major or not. I was talking to one of my professors about it and he showed me this simple little tool that’s a perfect starting point in respects to finding our passion. First he asked me what do I love to do? Then he asked, am I good at any of those things I love to do? Then finally he said do people need or value any of the things I am good at and love to do. Ask yourself these 3 questions and it’ll lead to your sweet spot in life.

We can toy with this equation too it’s not fixed. If we’re not finding the answer, we can dedicate some time to becoming better at the things we love that we also know the world values. We can even go as far as increasing the list of things we love to do by trying new things. Some we may like, some we may not. If it is not the right choice for you, you will know shortly after starting. But if we keep doing it, as time goes on that list of things we love to do will increase. 

Don’t over analyze or over think this part. Just google a list of hobbies and pick out a few that interest you. That your curious about and focus on one of them at a time to try out. 

Now if your discovering you’re not interested in anything then it’s likely your dopamine responses are off. Dopamine levels can have a lot more to do with passion than we would think on the surface. Paint a picture of yourself driving on a road leading you to your passion. Your dopamine levels being off will make that road foggy. The more cheap dopamine spikes we get from thing like TV, Video games, social media, high sugar foods, and other crap that throws off our dopamine responses off - The thicker that fog will be and the harder it will be to see the road we’re on. Then because the fog can become so thick we might miss an intersecting road that we we’re supposed to turn down or a road that just peaked our interest and would have been worth taking a detour on. 

In order to be passionate about things we need to let go of as many unnecessary dopamine spikes related to instant gratification as we can. When we watch a lot of TV, get high or drunk, or stay on social media all day it gives us an instant high dopamine response compared with what we should be getting as a delayed dopamine response while working on something we’re passionate about. If we avoid these things, we will naturally become passionate and happier about whatever we’re working on in life rather than just working on our image on Instagram. **Our dopamine responses have to come from what we create, not what we consume.** This is very important. With our dopamine responses in check we naturally seek out more dopamine responses through our creations and the work we put into our life. We’ll get our dopamine responses from earned activity like exercising, choosing the right foods to eat, completing tasks, and going for goals. Every instant high dopamine spike activity we let go of will make our road to passion clearer. 

So, in conclusion you can see how finding our passion will take some effort. This is exactly why the biggest block to most of us finding our passion is ourselves. Thinking we will just wake one day and suddenly know our purpose is wishful thinking at best. And when nothing comes to us, we tend to ask others what they think we should choose to do for our passion, defeating the whole concept of passion all together. This decision must be on our terms. Not what our mother or father thinks we should do and not what our friends think we should do. We can take suggestions, but the endgame of our life has to be a result of our own choices; and the biggest problem we have with passion, most of us don’t even get a chance to chase it, because we give up our dreams for a paycheck

I know it can be time consuming.  I know you have better shit to do.

Earlier today, I met an elderly gentleman at work (I'm a police officer).  He was nice enough, but it became clear that he was basically just looking for some company.  I made contact with this guy, who we'll call Jim.  Jim had a very simple problem - He was too weak to get his garbage pail down to the curb for garbage pick-up day and wanted to know if we could help him with that if needed.  Of course, this is the type of stuff we're here for.

Jim is wearing a WW2 veterans hat with a Sergeants pin on the brim.  I ask him ""Jim, is that your Sarge's pin on your hat?""  To which he responds yes.  We start talking.  Turns out, Jim is from a tiny US midwest town and went to WW2 in order to ""do what needed to be done"".  ""We had no idea about the Nazi's when we joined up...we just wanted to serve our Country""

Jim went on to tell me stories that literally left my jaw hanging.  He said he didn't like to talk about things, but because I was a police officer, he would talk with me.  How he was in France, Germany and, later, the Pacific.  He told me about his nurse wife, who ended up running off while he was away.  His new wife, who ended up passing of cancer.  His 2 boys, both of whom were also in the military.  He told me about how when he got out of the service and the war was over, how he went to work in his hometown as a factory worker.

Jim told me that he almost never spoke to anyone regarding the war and his experiences.  I asked if he ever spoke to his wife and kids, and he looked at me like I was nuts.  ""They have no need to know of these things.""  Fair enough I suppose.

He told me about people he had killed, in person, and right in front of him.  Almost as if it was simply a job.  ""Them boys had mama's, I knew it, but i tried not to think about it.""  Jim told me about factory life and his growing family..

Long story short, I asked Jim if he had talked to others about this, and he said, verbatim, ""who?  My kids are grown.  I don't see them.  You young people are so busy these days.""

tl;dr  This guy just wanted someone to talk to for a bit.  He wasn't annoying, he wasn't long-winded.  He was lonely.  At one point, he told me how he used to harvest corn on his dads farm.  He was lonely.  This generation is going to be completely gone soon, and if this is typical, they may not have folks to speak to and leave their stories behind.  We cant let the generation die with nothing.  Visit your old folks.  If you come across them, give it 5 minutes and BS with them.

I am a **senior** in high school and have been with most of classmates since **6th grade**. For the most part, a lot of them have gotten into **Ivy League** schools or **Honors Colleges** and are destined to achieve great things. There are some people, *however*, that I have the displeasure of watching their lives slowly waste away. From drugs to just not caring, it is safe to say these people have had a fall from grace ever since I met them in 6th grade. 

* The first person I will mention is a girl I actually met on my first day of middle school and remain a good friend of hers to this day. When we shared classes together, she always performed leagues beyond everyone else, it was obvious life had something well in store for her. As high school rolled around, her life took a bad turn. Freshmen year was the same as middle school, even outperforming me in classes such as algebra and history, but then drugs came along. At first, she was only vaping, and I told her that this habit would lead to her eventually becoming a junkie. She laughed at such a notion, but eventually that statement became reality. Sophomore year was a real turning point as she started to take high level classes, but because of being constantly high when at home, she did terribly. Because I developed feelings for her (some of which i still do hold), I helped her as much as I could. It saddened me that as I progressed, she seemed to only downgrade. By senior year, her *3.9 GPA* when all the way down to around a *2.4*. Watching a great friend of yours lose a chance at a good life because of a high school addiction is **very painful to witness.** 
* The next mention on this list is not a person, but rather, *a group of people.* The **burnout jocks** in my grade have a *surprising amount of people* who are **smart**, but just act stupid because of their friend group. Last year, in my chemistry class, the highest performing student was someone who everyone else thought was a complete dummy. I discussed this with my chemistry teacher last week, and she told me that if he were in a different environment, he would perform much better in school. I have had many classes with this individual, and to be honest, he always acts like a complete idiot when with his friends, but I learned that he really can be smart, but chooses to be stupid because of the people he's with. In the math class I am in right now, there is another burnout jock that I actually knew was very smart since middle school. Once again, he suffers the same fate as the last jock: their friend group prevents them from achieving optimum performance. Both of these guys share the same friend group of people who don't give a shit about high school. **They see it more as a chore and that is not at all what high school should be.** On weekends, they get higher than kites and get so drunk its not even funny. It upsets me greatly that these people have the capability of being smart, yet don't act on it because of the character they put on with their friends. Sadly, most of these people are now going to a community college where they will most likely act the same way and achieve nothing. 
* The last person I am to speak of is actually one of my **best friends.** He hangs out with some of the smartest people in the grade, and although this is a good thing, his scores and **grades are nothing in comparison**. He is a true *minimalist* who really has no direction in his life at the moment. In the beginning of the year, he went from telling me he was applying to college, to joining the marines, to saying he's going to a community college. He's not an idiot either, but the choices he's making right now are pretty idiotic. He easily could have applied to a decent college and gotten in, but decided instead to just not do anything. His SAT was a 1000, and I knew he could've improved, but when the day of the next exam came up, he blew it off because he was, ""tired."" I've been in school with this guy for six years and now that we've finally come to the biggest turning point of our lives, he's blowing it off. In the classes we have together, he doesn't try, and I even heard a teacher tell him he's, ""not college ready."" He says he has a plan all figured out, but I honestly think he's just saying that to put his mind at ease. He wishes to major in Marine Biology, but at this rate, nobody really thinks he's up for the challenge. His laid back, minimalist, lassiez faire, high school policy has proven to be a major setback in his life and it saddens me he' not achieving his true greatness. 

All in all, the message still remains the same: **give your all in high school.** I have seen the rise and fall of many students across many friend groups and wish everyone to not suffer the same fate. High school is what leads to the beginning of the rest of your life, and if you throw it away, the future is unknown and frightening.

High school is what leads to the beginning of the rest of your life, and if you throw it away, the future is unknown and frightening. This entire post &lt;strong&gt;may sound like i&amp;#39;m some pretentious cosmopolitan&lt;/strong&gt;, but I  am merely imploring all who read this to give this level of school your best shot, it may decide the fate of your future.&lt;/p&gt;

My kid is now older but I realized I messed up about a year ago. Did a quick google search to find out my son is named after a high ranking officer in the confederate army and gave probably the most racist speech in the history of the united states. Does not help that we&amp;#39;re white and in the deep south. We certainly didnt know that. We struggled finding a name and when we could finally agree upon one we were only down to the middle name. Middle name doesnt match but still.&lt;/p&gt;

I just wanted to share some tips on how to be comfortable and successful at work, school or anywhere else you have to communicate with other people. 

A very important thing is to not act how you feel. 
If you really dislike the people you're around and you have (bad) thoughts about them, don't show it.  Stay neutral.  Being hostile isn't the way to go, so the best thing to do is just go on about your day, and don't cause problems for yourself (unless you have to.)

If you're having a bad day, try not to let that have an affect on how you treat other people, or, affect your appearance.  You don't want to have negative energy.. that will turn people away from you (that's not good), unless that's what you want. 

If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  This is said very often, and in this case, it's helpful.  If what you say is going to offend someone, you probably shouldn't say it, just for your sake.  Even if you don't think you're being offensive, everyone doesn't think the same way or handle things the same.  So be mindful of what you say. 

If you need to remind yourself of these things on a daily, do so.  It will help!  If any of these are you and you really want to change, it is possible.  With work and determination you can better yourself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! &lt;/p&gt;

Wouldn't it be possible to use an older cellphone as a passthrough to get signal in the house? I'm thinking maybe as a ""fake"" cell tower.

Me and my wife want to help him, **badly**. We are not fit ourselves but we encourage each other to work out on the regular basis. We always try to invite him and encourage him to work out with us. We’ve invited him to hike, to run… to walk even, like just going to downtown or going to a town event. We even installed a 100 lbs. punching bag in our back yard that we (wife and I) train with every evening after work ([here](https://imgur.com/Xf6WnQw) is a still of a video we took. It is not much but it’s honest workout). We have all the necessary equipment (extra gloves, extra wraps, extra jumping ropes…) for him to just put on and follow up, have himself start as he sees fit and later push him to do certain drills once he gets better at it. We use a fitness app that teach us how and what do to on all levels of experience but the thing is, he lacks motivation — he has none whatsoever and we fear that soon it’ll be too late. I just want to find ways to reach out to him on a personal level and help him. If we can’t then maybe a psychologist will do the trick but he also refuses that mean (I personally had gone with a psychologist for more than a year and it has been a wonderful experience for me and it really helped me A LOT to learn about myself and my life and I am truly grateful for that).

He is into gaming and I am as well (PCMR), maybe I can reach out to him through there? He’s about to finish his engineer degree and he has yet to find himself a job. He does not have a lot of social life other than his gaming and university friends. He goes with them like once every 1-2 months or so…

Please Reddit, how do I motivate him to be healthier? How do I make him understand that it is not too late? That he has us for help, that he will not be judged. That getting healthier will have such of an enormous positive impact on him. I dream of the moment he starts noticing his weight reducing. Imagining him smiling looking himself in the mirror, happy that he has accomplished something he never thought possible. I want him a better quality of life and keep pushing himself for more!

Expanded version, because I like talking too much:
My phone was getting worse and worse at charging, I would put the cable in and it wouldn’t charge. 

I would try the connector at a different angle and that would work. It would vibrate every few seconds as the connection was flaky.

It helped if if twisted the cable around the phone to keep the connector at a certain angle.
I was ready to give up. 

Finally, I realized that I’m an idiot, and that the connector port was gunked up with lint and fibers and, well, gunk.

So I took a paperclip, scraped the inside of the lightning port, and voila, it’s good as new.

When I read back on my journal at the end of each year, I see funny memories that still make me laugh - a perfect excuse to start a conversation with and catch up with an old friend. The best part about this is that it helps me realize I'm not as alone as I tend to feel.

Every week, I also write a ""self-esteem check in,"" where I basically reflect on who I am. I write about what I like about myself and what I don't, what makes me happy and what pisses me off, etc. I started adding this section so that I could track my emotions when things start spiraling downwards. Also, the positive entries can bring me back up when I'm down.

This practice has been very, very helpful for me. I religiously take the time to write something everyday, even if it's short and uninteresting. It's my therapy - if you can be introspective, you will feel more in control of your emotions. It's also nice to rant there when I know I'm being irrational but need to get something off my chest.

Most people who frequent McDonald's know that they also have a menu item called the 20-piece McNuggets (regular price $6.10).

So yesterday, I roll up to the drive thru, see the advertised two 10-piece for $5 discount, and said ""*I'd like to order the 20-piece*"". The cashier said ""*okay 1st window please*"". I pull up to the 1st window and she tells me $6.74 is the total. I do some Rain Man level math in my head and tell her that's not right and ask her about the 2 for $5 promotion. She then tells me in a matter of fact tone: ""*oh yes, if you told me you wanted two 10-piece nuggets, you would've gotten the discount.*"" I stared blankly back at her dumbfounded and handed her my card.

I don't know if it's Corporate McD that told their employees to do this, or the cashiers themselves are purposely overcharging on the basis of semantics. But I find this behavior reeks of shadyness.

Right of way is a set of rules designed to maintain order, especially when vehicles are involved. Vehicles *are* dangerous and carry the very real capacity to injure or kill. It is extremely important that minimize this danger, which is partly done by maintaining order and thus keeping things predictable.

By giving up your right of way, you are not being friendly, but instead you are opening up the situation to become more unpredictable and dangerous. Obviously make sure others are yielding to your right of way before taking it, (again for safety as other drivers and pedestrians often make mistakes purposely or not) but don't give up your right of way for no reason.

Refresher for the U.S.:

- Whoever arrives at a stop sign first gets the right of way
- If two people show up at the stop sign at the same time, the person to the right gets right of way 
- Someone already on the road has the right of way over someone turning onto that road
- Pedestrians have the right of way at a crosswalk (unless signals say otherwise)

How does such wizardy work? It's pretty simple:

3. Upload an image or paste in the URL to the image.
4. ~~Profit~~  You'll get results suggesting what's in the picture.

We see things, hear things, (smell things!) and sometimes have to deal with things inside of those facilities.

That being said, I'm not trying to scare anyone, most facilities are great! But there are other facilities we dread getting calls to, and some we feel bad we have to drop patients off at. EMTs do the job for various reasons but we as individuals are not loyal to any one facility (even if our company has the contract it is the company that pays us, not the facility directly) and from my experience, we are willing to honestly tell someone what we think of certain facilities.

Things to consider when you want to ask. First, find out which local company has the contract with the facility(ies) you are thinking of placing your loved one in. It is not hidden/private knowledge so the facility should be able to tell you without an issue.

Second (and important!): Do not approach any EMTs while they are with a patient, OR if they are inside the specific facility. We may be truthful, but it is possible to get in trouble if someone from the facility hears us talk negatively about it. Wait until you see the EMTs without a patient (empty stretcher) and at least outside of the facility. Best thing would be to be as far from an entrance as possible. If you happen to see an EMT at a store, chances are they have a few minutes to answer some questions.

Third: do not ask them while they are transporting your loved one.

I felt bad, but tried to be as truthful as possible without negatively talking about the facility. For me, it made me feel awkward as you are already heading to the facility, its too late to change places, and I wouldnt want you or your loved one to go in thinking its the worst place.

All that being said, we do not see EVERYTHING going on inside the facility and we have experienced varying stories from patient to patient.

When you ask ""do you have any questions?"" it pre-supposes that the person doesn't have any questions. It's like saying ""you don't have any questions right? because if you did, you're stupid"". It's even worse if you are in a position of authority over the person your explaining something to (i.e. you're a teacher, a supervisor, etc...)
When you ask ""what questions do you have?"" it's like telling the person ""I expect you have questions, it's ok to ask for clarification"". It will totally change the responses you get, and the effectiveness of your teaching.
I'm a doctor, and I frequently need to explain something to someone that I understand better than they do. It's very easy to forget that a patient who's just come to the hospital to have a baby may have only had 1 or 2 babies, while you have gone through the process of caring for a pregnant woman thousands of times. You may think it's just another normal day, but for them, this could be something they've never done.
I see my colleagues all the time fall into a trap where they use big words, don't explain things in terms their patients can understand, and then intimidate them away from asking questions.
No matter what it is you're explaining, remember that if you are the one teaching or explaining something, you're doing so because you know more than the person you are talking to, and so it's only natural they will have questions. A very simple change in how your phrase your statements will totally change the response you get.

Houses in my Midwestern US city regularly sell at or above their asking price after only a day or two on the market. This means that there are often multiple offers from which a seller can choose to accept. If you suspect that you don't have the best offer, you can write a personal letter to the seller to explain who you are and what living in the house would mean to you. Don't grovel or make things up, just explain the connection you feel to the property. Including a nice picture or two also goes a long way toward turning you into a human instead of numbers on a sheet of paper.

In our example, we didn't get to meet the owner before submitting an offer; however, we knew a few things about him just from touring the home. We saw doggy food bowls in the kitchen, so we included our dog Watson in our letter (he even signed it!) It was apparent from the garage that the owner liked cars; I included a line about how I was hoping to use the big garage as my shop.

Keep your wits.

Give 911 quick, short, clear answers.

Don’t move seriously injured people unless you have to (like seeing flames in the car).

Keep people away from the road.

Don’t play doctor. Give basic first aid and possibly help with breathing (CPR) or major bleeding.

Keep the area clear (like keeping your car down the road) so emergency services have room to work.

This community has existed for nine years and has more subscribers than some smaller countries have citizens. (Belgium has 11.4m) 

We find  that over time our rules have become bloated and unwieldy, making the subreddit hard to moderate and more importantly, difficult to post to. 

Each rule we have was added for a very good reason at the time. (In the sidebar there is a rule saying no tips about rubber snakes. A few years ago there was an issue with rubber snake tips.)

But over the years we have added rule after rule and never removed any and this resulted in rules creep,  a sort of nightmarish morass you guys need to navigate when you want to post here. 

This ends today. We're massively overhauling the rules, removing most of the restricted tip list and making participating here a  lot easier.

------------------------------------

**Rules that we will keep**

No tips about:

Legal, parenting, driving, tips that break the law, hygiene (including toilet), religious, relationship, troll/ joke.

And no ads. No tips that are really just recommending a product or service. No ""Get Disney+, it's great"". 

----------------------------------------

It's going to take some time to get all this arranged, especially automod is a complete disaster of rule upon rule and legacy code that requires detailed attention. During this transition some posts that are not technically against the rules anymore may still be removed. We also reserve the right to keep removing content under moderator discretion, when we feel it's not a good fit for the sub but is not codified in our existing ruleset. 

But in general we feel that this overhaul will make it much simpler and enjoyable to participate here.

But often they don’t talk about how to do that. They just automatically spit out the cliché because it’s so widespread in our society. Cal Newport suggests “follow your passion” is terrible advice.

The first thing we need to understand about passion, is that passion is more about strategy than inspiration. We usually think along the lines of just waking up one day and we’ll randomly know our purpose. This law of attraction logic most likely won’t work in regard to finding our passions. Most of us find our passions in life through experimentation. It takes a bit of effort and self-analysis

And if you noticed I said PASSIONS, as in plural. I’m pointing that out because that’s another common misconception about passion. That we can only have one almighty singular passion in life. It’s mostly because of the influence of TV and society we think of passion as this singular thing. But it’s not

We can have several passions simultaneously. For instance, I myself love writing, love hitting the gym, love cooking and eat clean foods, and love learning new information. Most of us can have more than one passion. We aren’t bound to only one interest in life. 

Now before explaining how to find your passion this next point is the KEY to being able to become passionate about anything in your life in the first place. **Passion isn’t a starting point it’s a conclusion.** Meaning - we don’t start with passion, but we can end with it. 

Gaining Mastery in a subject is a fundamental part of passion. On the path to mastering anything we become passionate about that subject in general. The main point with this is to choose not only to become good at something, we need to aim high, remember we want to become a master at it and we can’t do that without aiming high. For example, not only do you want to write a book, you want to write a book that makes the best seller’s list. Not only do you want to open a restaurant; you want the best restaurant within 50 miles. By taking this high goal road, we start to look at the little details and intricacies of how everything connects in that field and we just sort of naturally get this need for more and more information about it - then we become fascinated with that subject and it leads us to becoming passionate about it. **Passion is automatic on the path to mastery**. 

So now let’s talk about how exactly we find our passions. I remember in my second year of college I was conflicted with if I choose the right major or not. I was talking to one of my professors about it and he showed me this simple little tool that’s a perfect starting point in respects to finding our passion. First he asked me what do I love to do? Then he asked, am I good at any of those things I love to do? Then finally he said do people need or value any of the things I am good at and love to do. Ask yourself these 3 questions and it’ll lead to your sweet spot in life.

We can toy with this equation too it’s not fixed. If we’re not finding the answer, we can dedicate some time to becoming better at the things we love that we also know the world values. We can even go as far as increasing the list of things we love to do by trying new things. Some we may like, some we may not. If it is not the right choice for you, you will know shortly after starting. But if we keep doing it, as time goes on that list of things we love to do will increase. 

Don’t over analyze or over think this part. Just google a list of hobbies and pick out a few that interest you. That your curious about and focus on one of them at a time to try out. 

Now if your discovering you’re not interested in anything then it’s likely your dopamine responses are off. Dopamine levels can have a lot more to do with passion than we would think on the surface. Paint a picture of yourself driving on a road leading you to your passion. Your dopamine levels being off will make that road foggy. The more cheap dopamine spikes we get from thing like TV, Video games, social media, high sugar foods, and other crap that throws off our dopamine responses off - The thicker that fog will be and the harder it will be to see the road we’re on. Then because the fog can become so thick we might miss an intersecting road that we we’re supposed to turn down or a road that just peaked our interest and would have been worth taking a detour on. 

In order to be passionate about things we need to let go of as many unnecessary dopamine spikes related to instant gratification as we can. When we watch a lot of TV, get high or drunk, or stay on social media all day it gives us an instant high dopamine response compared with what we should be getting as a delayed dopamine response while working on something we’re passionate about. If we avoid these things, we will naturally become passionate and happier about whatever we’re working on in life rather than just working on our image on Instagram. **Our dopamine responses have to come from what we create, not what we consume.** This is very important. With our dopamine responses in check we naturally seek out more dopamine responses through our creations and the work we put into our life. We’ll get our dopamine responses from earned activity like exercising, choosing the right foods to eat, completing tasks, and going for goals. Every instant high dopamine spike activity we let go of will make our road to passion clearer. 

So, in conclusion you can see how finding our passion will take some effort. This is exactly why the biggest block to most of us finding our passion is ourselves. Thinking we will just wake one day and suddenly know our purpose is wishful thinking at best. And when nothing comes to us, we tend to ask others what they think we should choose to do for our passion, defeating the whole concept of passion all together. This decision must be on our terms. Not what our mother or father thinks we should do and not what our friends think we should do. We can take suggestions, but the endgame of our life has to be a result of our own choices; and the biggest problem we have with passion, most of us don’t even get a chance to chase it, because we give up our dreams for a paycheck

Essentially I will offer a customer pretty much anything that springs to my mind that could possibly assist them but this became tiresome and difficult to do with multiple customers so I actively do the same thing but using a word like “don’t” or “wouldn’t” within the first phrase. 

e.g. “You wouldn’t want a drink, would you?” Instead of “would you like a drink?”. 

What I’ve noticed using this is that customers will say no 70% more often using the former rather than the latter regardless on whether or not they would like said offering because of the negative connotation and the subconscious thought of the offer not being accepted often by other people because of the word “wouldn’t”. This means that the average customer will think that you’re a polite person and will usually have something good to say to you or about you. 

I’ve noticed that this doesn’t work with close family or friends and will not work if the offering is too desirable to turn down, however this technique is still very good for first impressions and even if it doesn’t work you will still be doing something nice for someone else.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in retail and hate it with a passion, and was nearly fired twice for being impolite/out of touch with customers; however I started using reverse psychology on customers about 2 months ago and have had over 25 commendations from customers since. Essentially I will offer a customer pretty much anything that springs to my mind that could possibly assist them but this became tiresome and difficult to do with multiple customers so I actively do the same thing but using a word like “don’t” or “wouldn’t” within the first phrase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e.g. “You wouldn’t want a drink, would you?” Instead of “would you like a drink?”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve noticed using this is that customers will say no 70% more often using the former rather than the latter regardless on whether or not they would like said offering because of the negative connotation and the subconscious thought of the offer not being accepted often by other people because of the word “wouldn’t”. This means that the average customer will think that you’re a polite person and will usually have something good to say to you or about you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that this doesn’t work with close family or friends and will not work if the offering is too desirable to turn down, however this technique is still very good for first impressions and even if it doesn’t work you will still be doing something nice for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

I know it can be time consuming.  I know you have better shit to do.

Earlier today, I met an elderly gentleman at work (I'm a police officer).  He was nice enough, but it became clear that he was basically just looking for some company.  I made contact with this guy, who we'll call Jim.  Jim had a very simple problem - He was too weak to get his garbage pail down to the curb for garbage pick-up day and wanted to know if we could help him with that if needed.  Of course, this is the type of stuff we're here for.

Jim is wearing a WW2 veterans hat with a Sergeants pin on the brim.  I ask him ""Jim, is that your Sarge's pin on your hat?""  To which he responds yes.  We start talking.  Turns out, Jim is from a tiny US midwest town and went to WW2 in order to ""do what needed to be done"".  ""We had no idea about the Nazi's when we joined up...we just wanted to serve our Country""

Jim went on to tell me stories that literally left my jaw hanging.  He said he didn't like to talk about things, but because I was a police officer, he would talk with me.  How he was in France, Germany and, later, the Pacific.  He told me about his nurse wife, who ended up running off while he was away.  His new wife, who ended up passing of cancer.  His 2 boys, both of whom were also in the military.  He told me about how when he got out of the service and the war was over, how he went to work in his hometown as a factory worker.

Jim told me that he almost never spoke to anyone regarding the war and his experiences.  I asked if he ever spoke to his wife and kids, and he looked at me like I was nuts.  ""They have no need to know of these things.""  Fair enough I suppose.

He told me about people he had killed, in person, and right in front of him.  Almost as if it was simply a job.  ""Them boys had mama's, I knew it, but i tried not to think about it.""  Jim told me about factory life and his growing family..

Long story short, I asked Jim if he had talked to others about this, and he said, verbatim, ""who?  My kids are grown.  I don't see them.  You young people are so busy these days.""

tl;dr  This guy just wanted someone to talk to for a bit.  He wasn't annoying, he wasn't long-winded.  He was lonely.  At one point, he told me how he used to harvest corn on his dads farm.  He was lonely.  This generation is going to be completely gone soon, and if this is typical, they may not have folks to speak to and leave their stories behind.  We cant let the generation die with nothing.  Visit your old folks.  If you come across them, give it 5 minutes and BS with them.

I am a **senior** in high school and have been with most of classmates since **6th grade**. For the most part, a lot of them have gotten into **Ivy League** schools or **Honors Colleges** and are destined to achieve great things. There are some people, *however*, that I have the displeasure of watching their lives slowly waste away. From drugs to just not caring, it is safe to say these people have had a fall from grace ever since I met them in 6th grade. 

* The first person I will mention is a girl I actually met on my first day of middle school and remain a good friend of hers to this day. When we shared classes together, she always performed leagues beyond everyone else, it was obvious life had something well in store for her. As high school rolled around, her life took a bad turn. Freshmen year was the same as middle school, even outperforming me in classes such as algebra and history, but then drugs came along. At first, she was only vaping, and I told her that this habit would lead to her eventually becoming a junkie. She laughed at such a notion, but eventually that statement became reality. Sophomore year was a real turning point as she started to take high level classes, but because of being constantly high when at home, she did terribly. Because I developed feelings for her (some of which i still do hold), I helped her as much as I could. It saddened me that as I progressed, she seemed to only downgrade. By senior year, her *3.9 GPA* when all the way down to around a *2.4*. Watching a great friend of yours lose a chance at a good life because of a high school addiction is **very painful to witness.** 
* The next mention on this list is not a person, but rather, *a group of people.* The **burnout jocks** in my grade have a *surprising amount of people* who are **smart**, but just act stupid because of their friend group. Last year, in my chemistry class, the highest performing student was someone who everyone else thought was a complete dummy. I discussed this with my chemistry teacher last week, and she told me that if he were in a different environment, he would perform much better in school. I have had many classes with this individual, and to be honest, he always acts like a complete idiot when with his friends, but I learned that he really can be smart, but chooses to be stupid because of the people he's with. In the math class I am in right now, there is another burnout jock that I actually knew was very smart since middle school. Once again, he suffers the same fate as the last jock: their friend group prevents them from achieving optimum performance. Both of these guys share the same friend group of people who don't give a shit about high school. **They see it more as a chore and that is not at all what high school should be.** On weekends, they get higher than kites and get so drunk its not even funny. It upsets me greatly that these people have the capability of being smart, yet don't act on it because of the character they put on with their friends. Sadly, most of these people are now going to a community college where they will most likely act the same way and achieve nothing. 
* The last person I am to speak of is actually one of my **best friends.** He hangs out with some of the smartest people in the grade, and although this is a good thing, his scores and **grades are nothing in comparison**. He is a true *minimalist* who really has no direction in his life at the moment. In the beginning of the year, he went from telling me he was applying to college, to joining the marines, to saying he's going to a community college. He's not an idiot either, but the choices he's making right now are pretty idiotic. He easily could have applied to a decent college and gotten in, but decided instead to just not do anything. His SAT was a 1000, and I knew he could've improved, but when the day of the next exam came up, he blew it off because he was, ""tired."" I've been in school with this guy for six years and now that we've finally come to the biggest turning point of our lives, he's blowing it off. In the classes we have together, he doesn't try, and I even heard a teacher tell him he's, ""not college ready."" He says he has a plan all figured out, but I honestly think he's just saying that to put his mind at ease. He wishes to major in Marine Biology, but at this rate, nobody really thinks he's up for the challenge. His laid back, minimalist, lassiez faire, high school policy has proven to be a major setback in his life and it saddens me he' not achieving his true greatness. 

All in all, the message still remains the same: **give your all in high school.** I have seen the rise and fall of many students across many friend groups and wish everyone to not suffer the same fate. High school is what leads to the beginning of the rest of your life, and if you throw it away, the future is unknown and frightening. This entire post **may sound like i'm some pretentious cosmopolitan**, but I  am merely imploring all who read this to give this level of school your best shot, it may decide the fate of your future.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple tip, but it is one of great importance.

By senior year, her &lt;em&gt;3.9 GPA&lt;/em&gt; when all the way down to around a &lt;em&gt;2.4&lt;/em&gt;. Watching a great friend of yours lose a chance at a good life because of a high school addiction is &lt;strong&gt;very painful to witness.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next mention on this list is not a person, but rather, &lt;em&gt;a group of people.&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;burnout jocks&lt;/strong&gt; in my grade have a &lt;em&gt;surprising amount of people&lt;/em&gt; who are &lt;strong&gt;smart&lt;/strong&gt;, but just act stupid because of their friend group. Last year, in my chemistry class, the highest performing student was someone who everyone else thought was a complete dummy. I discussed this with my chemistry teacher last week, and she told me that if he were in a different environment, he would perform much better in school. I have had many classes with this individual, and to be honest, he always acts like a complete idiot when with his friends, but I learned that he really can be smart, but chooses to be stupid because of the people he&amp;#39;s with. In the math class I am in right now, there is another burnout jock that I actually knew was very smart since middle school. Once again, he suffers the same fate as the last jock: their friend group prevents them from achieving optimum performance. Both of these guys share the same friend group of people who don&amp;#39;t give a shit about high school. &lt;strong&gt;They see it more as a chore and that is not at all what high school should be.&lt;/strong&gt; On weekends, they get higher than kites and get so drunk its not even funny. It upsets me greatly that these people have the capability of being smart, yet don&amp;#39;t act on it because of the character they put on with their friends. Sadly, most of these people are now going to a community college where they will most likely act the same way and achieve nothing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last person I am to speak of is actually one of my &lt;strong&gt;best friends.&lt;/strong&gt; He hangs out with some of the smartest people in the grade, and although this is a good thing, his scores and &lt;strong&gt;grades are nothing in comparison&lt;/strong&gt;. He is a true &lt;em&gt;minimalist&lt;/em&gt; who really has no direction in his life at the moment. In the beginning of the year, he went from telling me he was applying to college, to joining the marines, to saying he&amp;#39;s going to a community college. He&amp;#39;s not an idiot either, but the choices he&amp;#39;s making right now are pretty idiotic. He easily could have applied to a decent college and gotten in, but decided instead to just not do anything. His SAT was a 1000, and I knew he could&amp;#39;ve improved, but when the day of the next exam came up, he blew it off because he was, &amp;quot;tired.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve been in school with this guy for six years and now that we&amp;#39;ve finally come to the biggest turning point of our lives, he&amp;#39;s blowing it off. In the classes we have together, he doesn&amp;#39;t try, and I even heard a teacher tell him he&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;not college ready.&amp;quot; He says he has a plan all figured out, but I honestly think he&amp;#39;s just saying that to put his mind at ease. He wishes to major in Marine Biology, but at this rate, nobody really thinks he&amp;#39;s up for the challenge. His laid back, minimalist, lassiez faire, high school policy has proven to be a major setback in his life and it saddens me he&amp;#39; not achieving his true greatness. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the message still remains the same: &lt;strong&gt;give your all in high school.&lt;/strong&gt; I have seen the rise and fall of many students across many friend groups and wish everyone to not suffer the same fate. High school is what leads to the beginning of the rest of your life, and if you throw it away, the future is unknown and frightening. This entire post &lt;strong&gt;may sound like i&amp;#39;m some pretentious cosmopolitan&lt;/strong&gt;, but I  am merely imploring all who read this to give this level of school your best shot, it may decide the fate of your future.&lt;/p&gt;

I just wanted to share some tips on how to be comfortable and successful at work, school or anywhere else you have to communicate with other people. 

A very important thing is to not act how you feel. 
If you really dislike the people you're around and you have (bad) thoughts about them, don't show it.  Stay neutral.  Being hostile isn't the way to go, so the best thing to do is just go on about your day, and don't cause problems for yourself (unless you have to.)

If you're having a bad day, try not to let that have an affect on how you treat other people, or, affect your appearance.  You don't want to have negative energy.. that will turn people away from you (that's not good), unless that's what you want. 

If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  This is said very often, and in this case, it's helpful.  If what you say is going to offend someone, you probably shouldn't say it, just for your sake.  Even if you don't think you're being offensive, everyone doesn't think the same way or handle things the same.  So be mindful of what you say. 

If you need to remind yourself of these things on a daily, do so.  It will help!  If any of these are you and you really want to change, it is possible.  With work and determination you can better yourself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! &lt;/p&gt;

Me and my wife want to help him, **badly**. We are not fit ourselves but we encourage each other to work out on the regular basis. We always try to invite him and encourage him to work out with us. We’ve invited him to hike, to run… to walk even, like just going to downtown or going to a town event. We even installed a 100 lbs. punching bag in our back yard that we (wife and I) train with every evening after work ([here](https://imgur.com/Xf6WnQw) is a still of a video we took. It is not much but it’s honest workout). We have all the necessary equipment (extra gloves, extra wraps, extra jumping ropes…) for him to just put on and follow up, have himself start as he sees fit and later push him to do certain drills once he gets better at it. We use a fitness app that teach us how and what do to on all levels of experience but the thing is, he lacks motivation — he has none whatsoever and we fear that soon it’ll be too late. I just want to find ways to reach out to him on a personal level and help him. If we can’t then maybe a psychologist will do the trick but he also refuses that mean (I personally had gone with a psychologist for more than a year and it has been a wonderful experience for me and it really helped me A LOT to learn about myself and my life and I am truly grateful for that).

He is into gaming and I am as well (PCMR), maybe I can reach out to him through there? He’s about to finish his engineer degree and he has yet to find himself a job. He does not have a lot of social life other than his gaming and university friends. He goes with them like once every 1-2 months or so…

Please Reddit, how do I motivate him to be healthier? How do I make him understand that it is not too late? That he has us for help, that he will not be judged. That getting healthier will have such of an enormous positive impact on him. I dream of the moment he starts noticing his weight reducing. Imagining him smiling looking himself in the mirror, happy that he has accomplished something he never thought possible. I want him a better quality of life and keep pushing himself for more!

Expanded version, because I like talking too much:
My phone was getting worse and worse at charging, I would put the cable in and it wouldn’t charge. 

I would try the connector at a different angle and that would work. It would vibrate every few seconds as the connection was flaky.

It helped if if twisted the cable around the phone to keep the connector at a certain angle.
I was ready to give up. 

Finally, I realized that I’m an idiot, and that the connector port was gunked up with lint and fibers and, well, gunk.

So I took a paperclip, scraped the inside of the lightning port, and voila, it’s good as new.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I realized that I’m an idiot, and that the connector port was gunked up with lint and fibers and, well, gunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took a paperclip, scraped the inside of the lightning port, and voila, it’s good as new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;facepalm at how long I endured this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know if it's Corporate McD that told their employees to do this, or the cashiers themselves are purposely overcharging on the basis of semantics. But I find this behavior reeks of shadyness.

Right of way is a set of rules designed to maintain order, especially when vehicles are involved. Vehicles *are* dangerous and carry the very real capacity to injure or kill. It is extremely important that minimize this danger, which is partly done by maintaining order and thus keeping things predictable.

By giving up your right of way, you are not being friendly, but instead you are opening up the situation to become more unpredictable and dangerous. Obviously make sure others are yielding to your right of way before taking it, (again for safety as other drivers and pedestrians often make mistakes purposely or not) but don't give up your right of way for no reason.

Refresher for the U.S.:

- Whoever arrives at a stop sign first gets the right of way
- If two people show up at the stop sign at the same time, the person to the right gets right of way 
- Someone already on the road has the right of way over someone turning onto that road
- Pedestrians have the right of way at a crosswalk (unless signals say otherwise)

Background: I am really into hoodies and they need to meet certain criteria to hit my my sweet spot: 

* 100% cotton, i.e. not 20% Polyester or more, 
* heavy weight fabric, i.e. 340g/m² grammature or more, 
* ideally with a slightly rough feeling of the inside shell

I've had hoodies by brands like Scotch&amp;Soda, The North Face, C&amp;A, NZA and some others - and consistently a similar model a few months later had a completely different fabric quality, even when the design was the same as with NZA, just different colors. They went from 100% cotton to a 60/40 Polyester blend and manufacturing went from Turkey to Bangladesh or the other way round.

So, if you like certain pieces of your wardrobe and want to get something similar: Don't go by brand, go by what you are actually looking for in terms of quality and don't stick with that label either for the next piece of clothing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;They buy in batches and the one piece you like because of its quality (fabric, cut, color, seams) will come back in a slightly different reincarnation next season - from a completely different manufacturing site.&lt;/p&gt;
